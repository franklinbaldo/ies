depends, or parm strings, the `__versions` symbol CRCs, or an appended module
signature trailer. No `open_binary`, Linux host, or `modinfo` program is
required. The CLI equivalent is `inspect-kernel-module PATH`. Preserve
artifact SHA-256, key order, duplicate keys, CRC hex, and section file ranges.
A missing section is observed absence when section names are known, not proof
the module never carried that metadata. `.gnu.linkonce.this_module` is reported
as present or absent; `struct module` stays unknown because its layout changes
with the kernel version. `__ksymtab` records are not decoded. The PKCS#7 range
and its SHA-256 are observed; certificate, signer, and digest coverage remain
unvalidated. An absent trailer is not proof the module is unsigned in another
container. gzip, xz, and zstd whole-file containers are unsupported and name
`external_decompression` as the next probe: use an external codec utility to
decompress into a separate file, then call `inspect_kernel_module` on that file. See
[Linux kernel modules](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/kernel-modules.md).

## CPython pyc files

Use `inspect_python_pyc` for an explicit local CPython 3.7–3.13 `.pyc` when the
question concerns the header magic, PEP 552 source hash or timestamp, nested
code-object names, or bytecode identity. No `open_binary`, Python installation,
or target execution is required. The CLI equivalent is `inspect-python-pyc PATH`.
Preserve artifact SHA-256, the 16-byte header fields, nested code names, and
bytecode SHA-256. Bytecode is not decompiled. A decoded header does not prove
the matching `.py` is present. See [CPython pyc inspection](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/python-pyc.md).

## Erlang BEAM files

Use `inspect_erlang_beam` for an explicit local `FOR1`/`BEAM` file when the
question concerns IFF chunks, atom names, exports, imports, lambdas, or the
Code header. No `open_binary`, Erlang installation, or bytecode execution is
required. The CLI equivalent is `inspect-erlang-beam PATH`. Preserve artifact
SHA-256, chunk file ranges, 1-based atom indices, and original atom spellings.
Missing optional tables stay null. For a few facts, use `detail: "summary"` with
a `beam` view selecting a collection, exact names/indices and fields; read later
pages from `parent_evidence_id` or the complete Evidence bundle. Same-name
exports retain every arity and original atom index. CLI summary delivery requires
`--evidence_output`. Null table counts remain distinct from decoded empty tables. See
[Erlang BEAM files](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/erlang-beam.md).

## SQLite snapshots

Use `inspect_sqlite_database` with an explicit local database snapshot for its
schema and optional rows from one exact ordinary table. It requires Node.js
24.x >=24.15 or 26+ with the native `DatabaseSync.limits` API. It also consumes the
existing sibling `-wal`; retain both original digests when citing its result.
Default output is a compact inventory; a selected table expands only its own
schema and samples 20 rows. Select `columns` to avoid irrelevant or large cells,
and request `schema_scope: "database"` only for complete schema details.
Choose `row_limit` when a finite sample is useful and keep truncation and
unspecified row order explicit. Virtual tables, shadow tables and views are
schema facts, not row-read targets. REA inspects private copies and leaves
the source files untouched; obtain a coherent quiescent database/WAL snapshot
before inspection. See [SQLite snapshots](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/data/sqlite-databases.md).

## Recorded Linux crashes

Use `inspect_recorded_crash` with an explicit Linux x86-64 ELF core path to
inspect historical thread registers, signals, raw notes and original file
ranges. It is independent of the active disassembler target. Source-bound
register values and note bytes are observations; missing notes, signal-thread
association and current executable/library identity remain unknown. PIDs are
historical metadata and never authorize live attach or control.

The optional `include_debugger_context` facet adds mapping candidates through
caller-supplied GDB/pwndbg in an owned core-only session. Display names do not
establish current file identity; zero reported flags leave permissions unknown.
Requested unavailable context fails with setup guidance. See
[recorded crashes](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/native/recorded-crashes.md)
for exact upstream profiles, bounds and verification coverage.

## Offline ELF layout

Use `inspect_binary_layout` with an explicit local ELF path for file-backed
sections, symbols, relocations, linkage names, and static mitigation inferences
without opening a disassembler target. When that complete record is already
retained, call `inspect_analysis_view` for a summary, mitigations or linkage
facet, one section or symbol, or a stable page. Do not re-run the decoder to
read a single object.

## Offline WASM

Use `inspect_wasm_artifact` with caller-supplied WABT for selected local bytes.
For counts, validation and WAT identity, select `detail: "summary"` on the first
MCP call. The complete original Evidence stays retained; use
`normalized_result.parent_evidence_id` for exact exports or text pages. Omitted
or complete detail keeps the existing complete result.
For a completed result, use `inspect_analysis_view` with its reported retained
reference for a summary or `view: {kind: "wasm", facet: "exports", offset: 0, limit: 32}`.
Facets also include sections, imports, candidates, glue, WAT, headers, details
and tool profile. Text offsets count UTF-16 code units; follow `next_offset`.
The complete source remains retained after an oversized MCP reply. No target
execution or network acquisition is implied, and WAT is decoded representation.

## Offline APK signatures

Use `inspect_apk_signature` for a selected local APK/ZIP/AAB. Default MCP summaries
retain complete Evidence. Select `view.collection: signers/digests/lineage`,
with scheme or ID batches, fields and paging; use `inspect_analysis_view` kind
`apk-signature` for retained reads after deletion. IDs retain artifact/scheme
scope and signer links; `fields: []` keeps identity links. Empty pages preserve
partial decoding reasons and unknown authenticity. CLI compact delivery needs
`--evidence_output` to preserve the complete parent.
It reads the APK
Signing Block (v2/v3/v3.1) and v1 `META-INF` signing without executing anything,
and reports each signer's certificate facts (for v1, the certificate the PKCS#7
block's SignerInfo names), the declared v3 rotation lineage,
the declared source-stamp certificate and, for SHA-256/SHA-512 digests, whether
the declared content digest matches the current bytes. That match is not a
signature verification: anyone who changes the bytes can recompute the digest.
`posture` summarises v1-only signing (which cannot tell a v1-only APK from one
whose v2/v3 block was removed), observed signer agreement across schemes,
whether the v1 signer equals the block-scheme signer (`false` is notable),
whether every differing signer appears in a declared (unverified) rotation
lineage, and the strongest scheme.
It never claims authenticity: no signature or lineage is cryptographically
verified.

## Native targets

After `open_binary`, use focused search, procedure, or function tools directly.
Use `binary_overview` when target metadata or inventory context helps answer the
question. Prefer literal search, names, decompilation, callers, callees, and
cross-references. Addresses and recovered pseudocode are analysis observations,
not original source. Provider unavailability and unsupported metadata remain
unknown rather than false.

For large pseudocode, request `procedure_pseudo_code` with `detail: "summary"`
on the first MCP call. It retains the complete observation and returns the
original selection, text availability and length without the body. Use
`normalized_result.parent_evidence_id` with `inspect_analysis_view` and
`view: {kind: "native", facet: "pseudocode", offset: 0, limit: 20000}`;
follow `coverage.next_offset` for later pages. Choose a smaller limit if one
page exceeds the client or transport budget. Offsets and limits count UTF-16
code units, not lines or tokens. Pages reuse the same observation without
repeating decompilation. Null and empty text remain distinct. Omitted or
`complete` detail preserves full inline delivery. Summary delivery requires a
retaining session and does not reduce the work or memory of decompilation.

For a completed `analyze_function` dossier, use `inspect_analysis_view` with
`view: {kind: "native", facet: "value_flow_operations", offset: 0, limit: 32}`
and the exact retained Evidence ID to read selected facts without reanalysis.
The default MCP reply is already a summary of that dossier: its
`normalized_result.parent_evidence_id` is the retained ID to page, and its
null counts mark facets the provider did not record or declared unavailable.
Native facets also include procedure, pseudocode, assembly, basic blocks,
comments, callers/callees, references, unresolved calls, referenced strings and
names, the native API record, and value-flow summaries. Pseudocode offsets and limits count UTF-16
code units; use the returned `next_offset` for continuation. Provider limitations
and unavailable facts remain explicit; the complete parent Evidence is retained.

`inspect_macho` on a large framework returns megabytes of imports and exports.
Select `detail: "summary"` for slice identity, UUID and per-collection counts,
then page rows with `view: {kind: "macho", facet: "exports", offset: 0, limit: 64}`
and `normalized_result.parent_evidence_id`. Facets are entrypoints,
architectures, build_metadata, load_commands, dependencies, imports, exports,
segments and provenance. `source_exhaustive: false` means unreturned symbols
may exist.

To see which functions or Objective-C methods a Mach-O actually calls in one
run, use `observe_native_calls` with explicit breakpoints and a bounded
`duration_ms`/`max_events`. It launches a new process under LLDB, so the target
runs and may change files or use the network. Hardened-runtime targets need the
`get-task-allow` entitlement.
Function breakpoints use exact LLDB runtime names: pass an `inspect_macho` export
or import `runtime_name` (`main`), not its symbol-table `name` (`_main`). REA does
not translate breakpoint names. Set `module` to the image
file name when selecting that image only; otherwise loaded system images also
match. Inspect retained locations and module paths before attributing a call.

Use `binary_session` with no arguments to check the open target, selected
provider, and alignment. Its default summary `result.tool_availability` carries
the complete tool inventory grouped by current status. Expand each group's
`names` and inherit the inventory-level client requirements unless a group
overrides them; availability, reasons, remediation, and modes remain inline.
Provider candidates keep availability and target-support status, code, and
reason. `omitted_fields` names what the summary leaves out; `{"detail":
"complete"}` adds each unavailable candidate's `remediation`, provider
diagnostics, candidate capability sets, and tool surface, `effects`, and
`annotations`. Those arrays name true flags from fixed
vocabularies, so an omitted known flag is false. `tools/list` remains the
canonical source for full tool schemas when target or provider state changes.

Provider capability groups carry provider identity and ordered limitations.
Prepend each set's `shared_limitations` to a group's `limitations` to recover the
operation's full ordered list. Candidate capabilities, returned with complete
detail, describe possible providers. Top-level session capabilities describe the current route, and
`analysis_provider_binding` identifies the selected provider.
