  `beam` view (collection, names/indices, fields and paging), retaining the full
  Evidence. CLI summary requires `--evidence_output`. Missing table counts stay
  null; decoded empty tables count zero. Bytecode is not executed. See the
  [Erlang BEAM guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/erlang-beam.md).

- Explicit local SQLite database snapshot: `inspect_sqlite_database`. Inspect
  with Node.js 24.x >=24.15 or 26+ providing native SQLite limits. Read schema
  first (compact inventory by default), or select an exact ordinary table
  and `columns` when rows are needed. Defaults are selected-table schema and
  20 rows; request `schema_scope: "database"` for the complete stored schema. Preserve both database and existing sibling WAL identity; row samples
  report truncation and have unspecified order. Use a quiescent snapshot rather
  than assuming a live database/WAL pair was copied atomically. See the
  [SQLite guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/data/sqlite-databases.md).
- Explicit Linux ELF file for offline layout, symbols, relocations or static
  mitigation evidence: `inspect_binary_layout`. This target-free operation uses
  caller-supplied pwntools without opening a disassembler database. Preserve its
  raw locations and inference/coverage limits; see the
  [offline binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/native/binary-diagnostics.md).
- Supplied Linux x86-64 ELF core: `inspect_recorded_crash`. Read every recorded
  thread, raw note and source-bound register without opening a live target.
  Historical PIDs do not select live processes. Request `include_debugger_context`
  only when core-only mapping candidates help; see the
  [recorded crash guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/native/recorded-crashes.md).
- PE resource type/name/language trees and static icon group references:
  `inspect_pe_resources` with an explicit path. This portable operation requires
  no active target or engine; opaque payloads retain file ranges and SHA-256.
- PE export directories and ELF dynamic-symbol exports: `inspect_native_exports`
  with an explicit path; portable, no active target or engine.
- Native executable, library, or analysis database: `open_binary`, then
  use focused analysis tools directly; call `binary_overview` when metadata or
  inventory context is useful and available from the selected provider.

For an existing IDA MCP configuration, use `open_binary` with the original
input binary and `provider_id: "ida"`; do not pass an `.idb` or `.i64` database.
The legacy attached profile binds the already-open GUI input by SHA-256 and
leaves its database open. The modern headless profile creates and closes an
owned private database without saving. Installation and registration reuse
[mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp](https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp); see the
[IDA provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/providers/ida-provider.md).
For migration to the separate native IDA MCP plugin, follow the guide's
[legacy attached migration](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/providers/ida-provider.md#migrate-a-legacy-attached-registration).
Replace the upstream registration explicitly; modern mrexodia tools are not the
native profile. Native attachment preserves the database but does not provide
direct callers; check session availability and the guide's verification limits.
Proceed directly to `analyze_function`, pseudocode, or function/string searches
after opening; IDA does not supply `binary_overview`. Consult session availability
when composing broader workflows. Modern direct callers and unsupported dossier
facets remain unknown; live IDA results are not replayed from snapshots.

With `REA_KUNA_COMMAND` configured, `provider_id: "kuna"` answers procedure
lists, lookups, pseudocode, assembly and `analyze_function` from Kuna's cached
whole-program export. Callers/callees use a separate body-free graph shared by
the session; `xrefs` returns exact-address incoming sites and filters forwarding
aliases. These queries and inventory lookups do not trigger a C export. Indirect
targets remain unknown and can make relationship coverage partial. Reference
caches expire on close; a fresh CLI process repeats the native reference walk.
Typed references, CFG, raw-memory tools and annotations remain unsupported. A cold first
answer can come from a single-function run (its limitations say so); assembly
waits for the export. For pseudocode and assembly, `raw_result.source` names the
cached `.c`/`.asm` file and byte span, which you may search directly instead of
calling per function. See the
[Kuna provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/kuna-provider.md).

If the user says only "my app" without a name, path, or target already selected
for this task, ask which app before searching for artifacts. Paths in unrelated
saved reports and nearby test fixtures do not select the user's target. Resolve
an actual human-readable app name to one clear installed artifact when possible;
ask when matches are ambiguous. Never choose an example app on the user's behalf.

In a target-free session, use `open_binary` to bind any archive/package or
native target whose analysis tool operates on the active target. Do not call an
unadvertised tool; inspect `binary_session` with `{}` and its
`result.tool_availability` for availability reasons and remediation. Expand each
group's `names` into entries, inheriting the inventory-level client requirements
unless the group overrides them. The grouped name union is the complete tool
inventory; use `tools/list` for canonical tool schemas. The default summary keeps
each provider candidate's availability and target-support status, code and
reason; `omitted_fields` lists what it leaves out. Request `{"detail": "complete"}`
only when you need an unavailable candidate's remediation, provider
diagnostics, candidate capability sets, or tool surface, effect and annotation
flags; in those closed flag vocabularies, listed
flags are true and omitted known flags are false. Provider candidate facts
describe possible providers, while top-level session capabilities describe the
current route and `analysis_provider_binding` names the selected provider. Do
not treat those scopes as interchangeable.

For editable Ghidra analysis that must survive a later agent process, select
the [owned Program checkpoint workflow](references/native-and-artifacts.md#continue-editable-ghidra-analysis-across-processes)
before making metadata edits. It is separate from Evidence/Unknown persistence.

For a Ghidra startup timeout on a large native target, follow
[deadline recovery](references/native-and-artifacts.md#ghidra-startup-deadline-recovery)
before abandoning deep analysis or repeating the same cold import. The default
330 seconds can be changed for new startup attempts through
`update_analysis_settings` using `ghidra.startup_timeout_ms`. Changing the
server's launch environment instead requires a new REA process.

## Work summary-first

Start with the default result and use its inline Evidence and graph context.
For a JavaScript application or ELF layout whose size is unknown or large,
call `analyze_javascript_application` or `inspect_binary_layout` with
`"detail": "summary"`, then inspect the retained `parent_evidence_id` with
`inspect_analysis_view`. Over MCP, `analyze_function` is summary-first without
a flag: its default reply is the summary, and the complete dossier stays
retained under `parent_evidence_id` for facet paging. Pass that ID as a
`retained-evidence` reference to `compare_functions`, or inside
`match_native_functions` `left_observations`/`right_observations` or
`build_call_path.functions`; request `"detail": "complete"` only when the
dossier must travel inline.
Use the same exact-reference form in other advertised logical Evidence inputs,
including optional sources, arrays and nested sources across domains. Each
source can independently be inline or retained; preserve its source identity,
coverage, partial facts and unknowns. A summary or inspection page has its own
Evidence ID: use `normalized_result.parent_evidence_id` when the consumer needs
the complete source. For portable CLI follow-ups, commands advertising
`--evidence-bundle` resolve references from that selected exported bundle.
See [Evidence composition](references/evidence-workflows.md) for scope and
recovery; file selectors are supported only where explicitly advertised.
Page module identities and select the returned `node_id` before requesting an
item; a single file path can represent several graph roles. Do not repeat an
identical analysis or rejected call without a changed input or resolved blocker.
Recheck session state when a lifecycle change makes that status useful.
Make a focused follow-up only when the
returned result leaves a specific question unanswered.

If MCP reports `resource_constraint` with `details.resource: "transport"`, call
`inspect_analysis_view` with its reported same-session Evidence reference for a
summary, one section/module, or a stable page. Use `trace_application_feature`
once a seed is known, or call `export_evidence_bundle` to write the complete
session to a selected path. The analysis remains complete in the ledger; avoid
repeating it merely to request the same oversized response. Complete CLI JSON
output also streams without a single MCP frame.

When the retained parent ID is unknown, use `get_evidence_bundle` with
`detail: "summary"` and exact filters for operation, target SHA-256,
analysis-profile digest or canonical procedure address. Select its returned
Evidence ID for the next view instead of requesting the complete bundle. When
that record has no supported view (for example an annotation), read it with
`detail: "records"` and an `evidence_id` filter; `missing_evidence_links`
names linked sources this session does not retain.
`retention: "complete-record"` means the whole record is stored; native
value-flow truncation and unknown metadata remain separate. For an exported
portable bundle, use `rea inspect-evidence-bundle` with JSON containing `path`,
`detail: "summary"` and the same `filters`. Reading that file still requires
validating its full contents within the local memory budget.

A client can also truncate a successful tool result without a REA transport
error. Treat that preview as incomplete; use the retained parent ID for smaller
views or export when the full record is needed. Do not parse the preview as
canonical JSON or repeat the producer. For JavaScript, read the
[module-view and trace recipes](references/javascript-applications.md) before
drilling into a large graph; a broad bidirectional trace can expand unrelated
containment relationships even after summary analysis.

Every conclusion must distinguish observations, inferences, and unknowns. Cite
Evidence IDs, preserve limitations and incomplete coverage, and never imply
that static analysis observed execution. Runtime requests execute the declared
target and lifecycle; do not broaden the target or action beyond those fields.

Within the user's requested investigation, call available analysis tools
directly. REA does not require permission grants or per-call approval flags.
The agent client can independently require approval. Follow the declared request
scope and the host's actual access requirements; use the recovery guide for an
observed client-policy rejection.

## Plan broader investigations

For requests that span multiple features or subsystems, use a staged workflow:

1. Turn the request into a checklist of questions and the evidence each answer
   needs. Resolve target identity and constraints from the conversation and
   workspace before asking for information again.
2. Inspect the current REA session, artifact identity, saved analysis database,
   bookmarks, and prior evidence. Reuse matching state; do not open duplicate
   sessions or repeat identical analysis.
