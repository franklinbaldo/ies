 facts, lossless integer registers, usedImages UUIDs, and
  documented classification matches. Only `bug_type` `"309"` yields a crash
  body; other types, including `"288"` stackshots, return no crash result.
  Opened Mach-O and dSYM UUID joins remain unobserved. See the
  [Apple IPS guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/apple-ips.md).
- Linux kernel module metadata: `inspect_kernel_module` with the explicit local
  ELF32/ELF64 relocatable file. This built-in target-free inspection requires
  no Linux host or `modinfo`. Preserve `.modinfo` key order and duplicate keys,
  `__versions` CRC hex, section file ranges, and the appended signature
  trailer's PKCS#7 SHA-256. A missing section is observed absence when section
  names are known, not proof the module never carried that metadata.
  `struct module` is not decoded. The signature is not validated. gzip, xz, and
  zstd containers are unsupported; decompress into a separate file with an
  external codec utility, then inspect the decompressed `ET_REL` image. See the
  [kernel module guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/kernel-modules.md).
- CPython 3.7–3.13 `.pyc` header, nested marshal code objects and bytecode
  identity: `inspect_python_pyc` with the explicit local file. This built-in
  target-free inspection requires no Python installation. Preserve magic,
  PEP 552 hash or mtime/size, nested names, and bytecode SHA-256. Bytecode is
  not decompiled, and a decoded header does not prove the matching `.py` is
  present. See the
  [CPython pyc guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/python-pyc.md).
- Erlang BEAM IFF container: `inspect_erlang_beam` with the explicit local
  `.beam` file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no Erlang
  installation. Preserve chunk names, atom order, export/import/lambda tables,
  and the Code header. For selected facts, prefer `detail: "summary"` plus a
  `beam` view (collection, names/indices, fields and paging), retaining the full
  Evidence. CLI summary requires `--evidence_output`. Missing table counts stay
  null; decoded empty tables count zero. Bytecode is not executed. See the
  [Erlang BEAM guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/erlang-beam.md).

- Explicit local SQLite database snapshot: `inspect_sqlite_database`. Inspect
  with Node.js 24.x >=24.15 or 26+ providing native SQLite limits. Read schema
  first (compact inventory by default), or select an exact ordinary table
  and `columns` when rows are needed. Defaults are selected-table schema and
  20 rows; request `schema_scope: "database"` for the complete stored schema. Preserve both database and existing sibling WAL identity; row samples
  report truncation and have unspecified order. Use a quiescent snapshot rather
  than assuming a live database/WAL pair was copied atomically. See the
  [SQLite guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/data/sqlite-databases.md).
- Explicit Linux ELF file for offline layout, symbols, relocations or static
  mitigation evidence: `inspect_binary_layout`. This target-free operation uses
  caller-supplied pwntools without opening a disassembler database. Preserve its
  raw locations and inference/coverage limits; see the
  [offline binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/native/binary-diagnostics.md).
- Supplied Linux x86-64 ELF core: `inspect_recorded_crash`. Read every recorded
  thread, raw note and source-bound register without opening a live target.
  Historical PIDs do not select live processes. Request `include_debugger_context`
  only when core-only mapping candidates help; see the
  [recorded crash guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/native/recorded-crashes.md).
- PE resource type/name/language trees and static icon group references:
  `inspect_pe_resources` with an explicit path. This portable operation requires
  no active target or engine; opaque payloads retain file ranges and SHA-256.
- PE export directories and ELF dynamic-symbol exports: `inspect_native_exports`
  with an explicit path; portable, no active target or engine.
- Native executable, library, or analysis database: `open_binary`, then
  use focused analysis tools directly; call `binary_overview` when metadata or
  inventory context is useful and available from the selected provider.

For an existing IDA MCP configuration, use `open_binary` with the original
input binary and `provider_id: "ida"`; do not pass an `.idb` or `.i64` database.
The legacy attached profile binds the already-open GUI input by SHA-256 and
leaves its database open. The modern headless profile creates and closes an
owned private database without saving. Installation and registration reuse
[mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp](https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp); see the
[IDA provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/providers/ida-provider.md).
For migration to the separate native IDA MCP plugin, follow the guide's
[legacy attached migration](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/providers/ida-provider.md#migrate-a-legacy-attached-registration).
Replace the upstream registration explicitly; modern mrexodia tools are not the
native profile. Native attachment preserves the database but does not provide
direct callers; check session availability and the guide's verification limits.
Proceed directly to `analyze_function`, pseudocode, or function/string searches
after opening; IDA does not supply `binary_overview`. Consult session availability
when composing broader workflows. Modern direct callers and unsupported dossier
facets remain unknown; live IDA results are not replayed from snapshots.

With `REA_KUNA_COMMAND` configured, `provider_id: "kuna"` answers procedure
lists, lookups, pseudocode, assembly and `analyze_function` from Kuna's cached
whole-program export. Callers/callees use a separate body-free graph shared by
the session; `xrefs` returns exact-address incoming sites and filters forwarding
aliases. These queries and inventory lookups do not trigger a C export. Indirect
targets remain unknown and can make relationship coverage partial. Reference
caches expire on close; a fresh CLI process repeats the native reference walk.
Typed references, CFG, raw-memory tools and annotations remain unsupported. A cold first
answer can come from a single-function run (its limitations say so); assembly
waits for the export. For pseudocode and assembly, `raw_result.source` names the
cached `.c`/`.asm` file and byte span, which you may search directly instead of
calling per function. See the
[Kuna provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/kuna-provider.md).

If the user says only "my app" without a name, path, or target already selected
for this task, ask which app before searching for artifacts. Paths in unrelated
saved reports and nearby test fixtures do not select the user's target. Resolve
an actual human-readable app name to one clear installed artifact when possible;
ask when matches are ambiguous. Never choose an example app on the user's behalf.

In a target-free session, use `open_binary` to bind any archive/package or
native target whose analysis tool operates on the active target. Do not call an
unadvertised tool; inspect `binary_session` with `{}` and its
`result.tool_availability` for availability reasons and remediation. Expand each
group's `names` into entries, inheriting the inventory-level client requirements
unless the group overrides them. The grouped name union is the complete tool
inventory; use `tools/list` for canonical tool schemas. The default summary keeps
each provider candidate's availability and target-support status, code and
reason; `omitted_fields` lists what it leaves out. Request `{"detail": "complete"}`
only when you need an unavailable candidate's remediation, provider
diagnostics, candidate capability sets, or tool surface, effect and annotation
flags; in those closed flag vocabularies, listed
flags are true and omitted known flags are false. Provider candidate facts
describe possible providers, while top-level session capabilities describe the
current route and `analysis_provider_binding` names the selected provider. Do
not treat those scopes as interchangeable.

For editable Ghidra analysis that must survive a later agent process, select
the [owned Program checkpoint workflow](references/native-and-artifacts.md#continue-editable-ghidra-analysis-across-processes)
before making metadata edits. It is separate from Evidence/Unknown persistence.

For a Ghidra startup timeout on a large native target, follow
[deadline recovery](references/native-and-artifacts.md#ghidra-startup-deadline-recovery)
before abandoning deep analysis or repeating the same cold import. The default
330 seconds can be changed for new startup attempts through
`update_analysis_settings` using `ghidra.startup_timeout_ms`. Changing the
server's launch environment instead requires a new REA process.
