# REA

Use REA when a claim depends on a shipped binary or package, decompilation,
requested runtime evidence, or comparison with
behavior not established by available source. For ordinary analysis of a
complete source repository, use normal repository tools and do not run REA
readiness or provider commands.

## Connect only when needed

Installing this skill supplies instructions; it does not register the REA MCP
server, install analysis engines, or add tools to an already-running agent.
The exception is a Claude Code or Codex plugin install: the plugin bundles
this skill and registers its own `rea` server, outside the state that
`rea setup` and `rea doctor` manage.

If REA tools are available and their registration is not known to be stale,
proceed directly to the target. Do not run diagnostics or setup before every
investigation. Use the connected server's actual tool list and input schemas;
a skill installed from repository main may describe capabilities absent from
an older npm release. Keep complete inline Evidence when that server does not
advertise retained references.

If tools are absent, a call is blocked by the client, or a required provider is
unavailable, read [connection and recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md).
Diagnose the observed blocker, continue useful supported work, and resume the
original task after repair. Client approval, shell PATH, registration and engine
availability have different remedies; avoid repeating setup for all of them.
If the host times out without a REA result, do not repeat the unchanged call or
assume work stopped. Read the recovery guide's deadline distinction before retrying.
If the MCP connection drops, retry that call once only when it is safe to
repeat or known not to have started. If it may already have changed the
target, or it fails again, tell the user and ask them to restart the MCP
client. If REA could not start its connection, retry once, then tell the user
and ask them to restart the MCP client. Do not retry a startup failure that
returns the same unchanged result. For plugin installs, follow
[plugin recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md#rea-installed-as-a-client-plugin).
For setup-owned registrations, run `rea doctor` when REA could not start
or tools stay missing after that restart. For `cleanup_incomplete`, a retryable
capacity limit, or `configuration_invalid`, follow the recovery guide's ladder
before asking for a restart. Read that guide before a second repair attempt.

Choose the installation owner before repairing registration. Plugin installs use
[plugin recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md#rea-installed-as-a-client-plugin);
only setup-owned registrations use the guide's
[registration repair plan](references/connection-and-recovery.md#repair-registration-when-needed).
A plugin-only doctor result of `missing` does not call for `rea setup`.

REA setup never installs or upgrades Node.js, npm, Homebrew, Java, Ghidra, IDA,
JADX, Kuna, Binwalk, or Unblob. Use existing prerequisites; do not install unrelated
software to repair MCP registration. For an unsupported client, use manual stdio
registration with an existing installation’s absolute runtime and entry script, or continue through the CLI.

A concrete CLI fallback for an operator-supplied JavaScript tree or ASAR is:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

No MCP registration or native engine is required. Read the returned Evidence,
graph, limitations, and unknowns with the same care as an MCP result; the CLI
returns the Evidence record directly. This fallback does not establish that
MCP is configured. Native CLI tasks still require their selected engine.
Prefer an existing `rea` CLI. When none is installed and REA package acquisition
is within the authorized scope, use `npx -y rea-agents@latest` in its place from a
trusted directory outside the target project, with absolute target paths. Managed
setup binds the current installation directly; retain its runtime and package
cache entry, or restore that installation before repairing its registration.
For setup-owned registration, configuration repair starts with a read-only setup plan; show paths, backups and
skill replacement before applying authorized changes. Preserve existing approval
and target-execution boundaries.

## Route the target first

Choose the first tool from the target the user supplied. Use `open_binary` for
active-target native or archive workflows; target-free tools take their own
explicit path or endpoint and do not need it.

- ASAR or extracted JavaScript/Electron tree:
  `analyze_javascript_application`.
- Archive/package member inventory (ZIP/APK/IPA/MSIX/AppX, DMG, or a PyInstaller
  executable): `open_binary` with the supplied local path; use `inspect_artifact`
  when its graph and findings help answer the question. A PyInstaller CArchive
  is the application layer; the bootloader is only the native prefix. Start with
  `detail: "summary"` for large inventories, then use retained inventory views
  for selected member fields/pages. A complete small inventory can cost less
  than extra calls and schemas. Runtime options are metadata, not files.
  Compact delivery still inventories and hashes members. See the
  [Python packaged applications guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/python-packaged-applications.md).
- Bun `--compile` executable: `open_binary`, then `inspect_artifact`; the Bun
  module graph is the application layer. Extract stored modules and analyze the
  JavaScript. See [Bun standalone executables](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/bun-standalone.md).
- Apple app plist, Interface Builder, asset catalog, or keyed archive resources:
  `open_bundle_resources`, then the selected resource tool. This does not
  require `CFBundleExecutable` or a deep provider. Resource sessions have no
  executable digest or binary snapshot; use `open_binary` for native code.
- Android APK code, classes, methods, or incoming references:
  `inspect_android_package`, then focused Android tools when advertised.
  Archive member inventory still uses the archive route above.
- Managed PE/CLI assembly: `inspect_managed_artifact`.
- Firmware image: `inspect_firmware_regions` when advertised. Use
  `extract_firmware` when extraction is requested, with a caller-selected new
  absolute output directory. These tools use caller-supplied Binwalk/Unblob on
  Linux; see the [firmware guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/firmware/firmware-analysis.md).
- ESP32-family app or bootloader image (`0xE9` magic): `inspect_artifact`
  without a provider; see the ESP section of `references/native-and-artifacts.md`.
- .NET NativeAOT PE/ELF: native Ghidra analysis. Native code can yield pseudocode;
  consult the NativeAOT workflow in `references/native-and-artifacts.md` for
  optional metadata recovery and its supported host/layout boundary.
- Native program behavior, live calls, instrumentation, or command-run effects:
  choose the matching [native runtime workflow](references/runtime-observation.md#native-runtime-questions).
  `open_binary` and `trace_native_values` establish static facts; they do not
  observe execution. Runtime tools have distinct launch, attach, mutation and
  cleanup effects, and do not require a preliminary static session unless their
  own contract says so.
- User-owned browser page already open: `list_browser_targets`.
- Passive traffic capture of a SPA: the default scope is the page's own origin,
  and data APIs usually live on another origin. Discover API origins from
  absolute URLs in loaded bundles or script text via JavaScript analysis tools
  (another passive capture without those origins still scopes to the page
  origin, and `completeness.excluded` counts lack URLs). Pass both the page
  origin and those API origins in `allowed_origins` — the list replaces the
  default scope — and read `completeness.excluded` before reporting that an
  API is absent. For long captures with body shapes, use
  `export_evidence_bundle` instead of expecting an inline result.
- Browser action the agent must perform (click, type, navigate):
  `capture_browser_scenario` with declared actions. See
  [runtime observation](references/runtime-observation.md) for connect/launch
  and the focused follow-up browser tools.
- Agent environment (AgentEnv bundle) of a web application: read
  [environments](references/environments.md) before recording; it records with
  `capture_browser_scenario` and writes the bundle with `export_environment_bundle`.
- Task for a desktop application's exported environment, from a
  `capture-desktop-application` folder: read
  [desktop application tasks](references/environments.md#tasks-for-a-desktop-application-environment).
- Environment of a Linux desktop app with a task, from a request such as
  "build me an Inkscape environment where the agent changes a poster's
  headline": read [desktop builds](references/desktop-build.md). You drive the
  app on a build computer from `start_build_computer`, then export and witness.
- Fiddler Everywhere traffic or a native `.saz` capture: read the
  [Fiddler workflow](references/runtime-observation.md#fiddler-everywhere-traffic-debugging).
  Inspect saved SAZ with `inspect_web_network_capture` and `format: "saz"`;
  connect Everywhere's separate MCP server for live traffic.
- Retained HAR/SAZ/native mitmproxy/aioquic qlog capture: `inspect_web_network_capture`. Select
  original record ordinals when useful; inspect producer fields and byte/number
  sidecars without fetching recorded URLs or claiming live attribution. HAR/SAZ/qlog
  old-generation heap is `REA_CAPTURE_DECODER_OLD_GENERATION_MIB` (default 192 MiB,
  floor 8, maximum 16384), set where REA starts. Host memory and `NODE_OPTIONS` do not
  raise it. See
  [historical captures](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/guides/web/web-network-captures.md) for the exact upstream
  profile and credential exclusions. Qlog support starts with aioquic 1.5.0
  JSON 0.3; stream coverage and endpoint loss declarations do not recover bodies
  or establish network loss. Prefer detail summary, then kind qlog trace/stream
  pages; select one trace, stream ID and direction for contribution/range pages.
  Facts retain all-recorded-events-before-selection scope. Other qlog layouts
  and PCAP correlation are unsupported.
