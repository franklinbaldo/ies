3. Start with the smallest useful overview or inventory. Follow each question
   from its entry point through relevant data and state changes to its result.
   Batch related operations around a specific hypothesis, then expand only when
   the returned evidence leaves a concrete gap.
4. Inspect relevant packaged resources and configuration alongside code when
   they affect the question. Use format-aware inventory and parsers; do not
   infer behavior from filenames, strings, or layout alone.
5. Corroborate a conclusion with the evidence type it requires. Use runtime
   observation only when static evidence cannot answer the question and the
   required host runtime and OS access are available. For JavaScript behavior,
   run probes against the actual app through the available browser, Electron,
   or process capture workflow.
6. Decompose work into independent questions. When parallel workers are
   available and the questions do not depend on one another, assign distinct
   scopes, point workers to existing evidence, and ask them to return sources,
   conclusions, and unresolved gaps. Otherwise, work sequentially.
7. Keep a concise finding ledger linking each conclusion to Evidence IDs,
   confidence/evidence type, search boundary, and remaining unknowns. Update
   the shared index or investigation report so later passes can reuse results.

Before finishing, revisit the original checklist. Mark each question as
answered, partially answered, or unresolved based on its evidence; keep
bounded negative searches bounded, and do not describe a broad investigation
as complete while required questions remain open.

## Finish the task

Explain findings in plain language and tie them to returned evidence. When the
user asks to build something, use normal coding tools and separate observed
behavior from design choices. Close an opened native session with
`close_binary` when its engine is no longer needed. Evidence references and Unknown
history remain in memory on the same MCP connection. End the investigation with
`reset_investigation`; supply `save_path` to checkpoint the complete bundle before
clearing. Import the saved bundle to restore original references and Unknown
history in a new process. Retention is bounded and is not automatic persistence.
